<h1>Boxes and Bins</h1>

<p>Boxes and Bins is a contextual text editor, i'll describe what that means in more depth later.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>I've recently begun porting the rails code over to sinatra. The rational is that at this point, Boxes and Bins has a pretty simple backend, so the framework should reflect that.</p>

<p>In order to complete the migration, I need to:
1. setup the schema.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>create a template page, which will be copied everytime a new page is created.</p></li>
<li><p>port the models over, so that we can get all the content we need for each new page or page load.</p></li>
</ol>
